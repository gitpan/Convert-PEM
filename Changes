Revision history for Convert::PEM

0.05  2001.05.11
    - Changed explode/implode so that they return/get list of headers
      in order in which they appear in the file. This fixes the bug
      where openssl-compatible PEM readers (like ssh-keygen in OpenSSH)
      could sometimes not read encrypted files (depending on the order
      given to the headers by the has).

0.04  2001.04.22
    - Changed 'Source' param back to 'Content'.

0.03  2001.04.21
    - Added test suite.
    - Added encode/decode methods, which are the encoding and decoding
      routines, broken out into separate methods. read and write are
      now implemented as wrappers around decode and encode. This allows
      for more flexibility.

0.02  2001.04.20
    - Added Content parameter to read method; bypasses file-reading.

0.01  2001.04.20
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.19
